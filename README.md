## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a SURA Postdoctoral Research Associate at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. I develop large-scale data management and analysis techniques for HEASARC and the Fornax Initiative. My research focuses on high-energy astrophysics, leveraging data from X-ray and gamma-ray observatories such as Chandra and Fermi-LAT to study energetic phenomena within our Galaxy.
